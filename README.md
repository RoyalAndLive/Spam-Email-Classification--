## Learning Objectives:

(a) Practice communication and organization skill;
(b) Practice writing skill and presentation skill;
(c) Survey current capabilities of AI software;
(d) Learn how to evaluate AI software;

## Task:

Carry out an evaluation of at least 2 pieces of AI software/package that can solve the same
problem (i.e., do not survey one software for knowledge representation the other on
planning) so that you can compare their performance. You should select one software from
one package and compare more than one package. Based on the commonalities, carry out
a comparison between the (two) chosen pieces of software. Finally, you should make
appropriate recommendations to the choice of using which AI software for specific tasks.

## Topics:

1. RNN/LSTM

2. CNN

3. BERT



## Issues for Consideration:

(a) Justify why you have selected the pieces of AI software for comparison;
(b) Can you draw a matrix of features, as well as pros and cons, of the chosen pieces of
software for comparison?
(c) Can you objectively/subjectively evaluate the performance (e.g., effectiveness,
efficiency, user friendliness, ease for development, etc.) of the chosen pieces of
software? For example, download the demo version of the software and apply it to
some test data to measure the effectiveness for comparison.
(d) What measurements should you use to compare the software?
(e) Do you think that your comparison is fair?
(f) What practical problems are there to deal with when using such software, especially
when the problem size is big for real-world applications?
(g) Which software would you recommend to solve what problems?
